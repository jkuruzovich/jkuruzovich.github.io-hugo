 ### Notes
 
 This is my first time using Hugo, which seems like a wickedly cool piece of technology. The `/content/home` directory has different sections that go on the home page.  These different sections are referenced in the main `config.toml` file. 

 The order on the home page is characterized by the weight in the file `/content/home`, with small numbers beign higher.
